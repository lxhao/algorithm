0) real check for memmove and enable replacement for it.

1) priority: high; assigned to: Sandro Bonazzola
Add to configure.ac the following flags:

/* --- CPP parsing options --- */
#define PRINTF_DEBUG            /* enable this to print some debugging messages */
#undef ON_THE_FLY_CONVERSION	/* enable this for line ending conversion */
#define BRAIN_DEAD_CAST         /* if your compiler is brainwashed and does not cast standard types.h structures */
#define AUTO_INDEX              /* enables auto-index of directories */
#define SOCKADDR_REUSE          /* enables reuse oth the socket (quick relaunch) */
#define ADDR_LEN_TYPE_INT       /* in accept() if addrlen is int */

2) priority: critical: assigned to: Riccardo Mottola
test the following defs (main.h) under any available platform :-)
- MAXNAMLEN
- S_IFDIR
- S_IFMT
I've taken the values from <dirent.h> and `man 2 stat` but I'm not sure they are safe values...
Actually I've tested the above constants only under Linux and Cygnus. (S. Bonazzola)


3) priority: high; assigned to: anybody
Update the documentation.

Code and Feature related:
- CGI should pass content length to script as env variable
- error messaging should be cleaner
- HTTP error codes are primitive and incomplete
- HTTP respsonse should contain status code
- Errors should send byte-size in mime header and log it
  and build instructions
- HEAD method should always return only the header, while some errors use full response!!!
- there is a minor glitch in the error reporting when a buffer overflow on request read occours

4) security related:
implement drop privileges after socket was accepted
