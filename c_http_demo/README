Current Version:   3.4


WHAT IS IT ?
------------

pServ is a small, portable HTTP server. It is written in pure C for speed and
portability. BSD-style sockets are needed to compile. It runs as a standalone program
and does not require inetd.
It should be small enough to be used in a mobile computer or to be run on your obsolete
workstation you have somewhere. We would be happy to know about every strange platform
it was ported to.

NOTES
-----
- correct execution of a CGI script is recognized from the result of program
  execution. So be sure to terminate with the correct return 0 in case of
  correct execution and return != 0 otherwise.
- the server can access files, exectuables and links with the permissions
  which is run with. That is, if you run is as root it can access probably most
  of your file system. So always run pico server with the least possible
  user level and be very careful with symbolic links and cgi scripts

KNWON BUGS
----------
- not implemented METHOD should respond with 503


LIMITATIONS
-----------
- Keep-Alive connections are not handled and
  always closed.
- on the fly conversion for non-unix-style text files is extremely poor
  (correction: the mac-> unix correction works fine but not with DOS files
  for which there is no need since cr-lf should be always recognized
